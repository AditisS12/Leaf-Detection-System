# Resume Screening App
The Resume Screening App is an AI-based application designed to automate the initial resume shortlisting process. It analyzes resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information such as skills, experience, education, and keywords, and matches them against job descriptions. The system helps recruiters quickly identify suitable candidates, reduce manual effort, and improve hiring efficiency by providing relevance scores or ranked candidate lists.
